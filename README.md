End-of-course project: Exploratory data analysis

In this activity, I will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis.

**The purpose** of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a provided dataset.

**The goal** is to continue the examination of the data that I began in the previous Course, adding relevant visualizations that help communicate the story that the data tells.
